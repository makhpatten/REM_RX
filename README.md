REM_RX_GUI Remote Receiver GUI
<br>
This is a web based GUI embedded in a prototype product. 
The webserver is written in C++/HTML for a Netburner SB70C card (implementing Freescale ARM) and interfaces to a radio, allowing real-time audio and remote control of the radio functions.<br>
<br>
This demonstrates use of webpage controls, and implements AJAX (Asynchronous Javascript and XML) for smooth update of displays (RSSI and audio signal level).<br><br>
